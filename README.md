# 1.1.3FlowerGarden

Our code takes in a prompt from the reader.

We see how many flowers we need to print and which flower. If the flower is one of the 5 we draw we will the draw the flower.

To find the key words we split the input and looked for the flower name and numbers.

The max flowers we allowed the user to print is 30
